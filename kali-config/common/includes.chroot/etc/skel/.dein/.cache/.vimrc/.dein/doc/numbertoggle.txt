INTRODUCTION                                    *numbertoggle*

In a buffer with "hybrid" line numbers (`:set number relativenumber`),
numbertoggle switches to absolute line numbers (`:set number norelativenumber`)
automatically when relative numbers don't make sense.

Relative numbers are only used in a buffer that has focus, and is in normal
mode, since that's where you move around. They're turned off when you switch
out of Vim, switch to another split, or when you go into insert mode.

LEGACY SUPPORT                                  *numbertoggle-legacy*

Since version 2.0, numbertoggle dropped support for Vim < 7.3, and removed its
configuration options in favor of a simple implementation with sensible
defaults. If that doesn't work for you or your setup, you can switch to the
legacy version by installing it from the legacy branch at
<https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle/tree/legacy>.

Also, numbertoggle doesn't set up a trigger to switch between line number
modes anymore. To set one up yourself using <C-n>, use:
>
    :nnoremap <silent> <C-n> :set relativenumber!<cr>
