1) I abstract the cStructure used in parse-param
2) I distinguish two types of keywords, some of them (yaccInitKey) only make sense in the initial block.
3) I declare the new structures bisonPrologue and bisonInitialAction
4) I have made comments contained. This was necessary when the file started with a comment, because yaccInit matches at the beginning of file.
5) It is legal to include whitespace and comments in the same line a section separators.
6) I contain yaccKey and yaccKeyActn in yaccCode and cParen.
7) Support for locations
8) Double-quoted strings are legal too.
